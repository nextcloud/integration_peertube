Usage terms

The term “Marks” includes anything we use to identify our goods or services, including our names, logos, icons, and design elements. By using OpenAI’s Marks, you agree that we own them and that any goodwill generated by your use benefits us. Your permission to use our Marks is limited in the following ways:

* You can only use our Marks as allowed by these brand guidelines.
* The permission we grant is non-exclusive (we can give it to others) and non-transferrable (you cannot give it to others).
* You should not feature our Marks more prominently than your own company’s name or marks.
* We may update the guide, and you must follow changes within a reasonable time.
* We can review your use of our Marks and require changes if needed.
* We may terminate your permission to use our Marks at any time, and you must stop using them promptly.

Please ensure your app follows all OpenAI usage policies⁠. If your project leverages our APIs or models (e.g. GPT-4 or DALL·E 3). You may choose to reference a specific model  but be precise and accurate.

We do not permit model names in app titles because there is concern that it confuses end users and it also triggers our enforcement mechanisms. GPTs are custom versions of ChatGPT, so it’s important that you do not reference just GPT in your app descriptions (we do not permit our GPT brand to be used in app, product, developer or company names).
